        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. The book, set in New England in the near future, posits a Christian fundamentalist theocratic regime in the former United States that arose as a response to a fertility crisis.<br>
        Offred’s recollections reveal that she was the daughter of a feminist activist. Before the advent of the theocratic government, the protagonist attended university and had a close friend named Moira. Offred became involved with a married man, eventually wed, and had a daughter. Following a military coup, the country became the Republic of Gilead. One day the protagonist was fired from her job at the library because women were no longer permitted to work. That evening she learned that women were also not allowed to have money, and her bank account had been transferred to Luke. They tried to flee to Canada with their daughter but were caught, and she was sent to a reeducation centre for indoctrination in preparation for becoming a Handmaid.<br>
        All women are assigned to various classes: the chaste childless Wives of the Commanders; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the Wives and are called by the names of their assigned Commanders.</p>

Handmaids show which Commander owns them by adopting their Commanders’ names, such as Fred, and preceding them with “Of.” Offred remembers her real name but never reveals it. She no longer has family or friends, though she has flashbacks to a time in which she had a daughter and a husband named Luke.</td>

Serena’s unhappiness shows that her restrictive, male-dominated society cannot bring happiness even to its most pampered and powerful women.</td>
